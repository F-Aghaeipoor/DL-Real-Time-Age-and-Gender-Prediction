# Real-Time gender and age prediction

This project is to predict age and gender of real-time frames taken from webcam videos.  

# Context

The images are taken from the webcam stream live using the cv2 module and the model is trained on the UTKFace dataset available in https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new.

# Data 

UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with a long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variations in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.

# Testing on real time frames

The model is validating as follows:
