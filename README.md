# Real-Time gender and age prediction

This project is to predict age and gender of real time frams taken from webcam videos.  

The images are taken from the webcam stream live using the cv2 module and the model is trained on UTKFace dataset available in https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new.

UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc.

The model is working as follows:
